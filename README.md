# SDAIA competition: Detection and evaluation of the following elements on street imagery taken from a moving vehicle



Project overview: In this project, Our main aimed to find the most polluted areas and have quick actions on those areas to have a cleaner environment for everyone to enjoy.

Challenges: One of the first challenges we faced was using the provided train data and changing it to an acceptable format for YOLO. Second challenge was the problem with the bounding boxes not being accurate to the object. Third challenge was to build KPIâ€™s and an index from the available information, we used what ever available to get an accurate understanding of the environment in the pictures and give it an index score based on the severity of the pollution.

Scalability: Scalability has many sides, we can add more datasets to cover more object, we can make data collection based on IOT devices that can be installed in different places, we can even use citizen involvement in their data collection in that is what we did in this project.

Open-source software: Open-source software used - Python, YOLOv5 and Pytorch and many other libraries like Pandas and OpenCV.

New data or resources: As we mentioned in the scalability part, it all depends on where you are going to deploy the solution, we would have loved if we can get the location of the images, more classes to add, higher training resources, check any implemented solution at the moment and try to integrate it with this project.
